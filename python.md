## Solutions

Problem 1:
{% highlight python %}

  ##########################################################################
  # multiples of 3 and 5
  # If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5,
  # we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of
  # all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
  ##########################################################################
  i = 0; sum =0;
  while (i<1000):
  	if (i%3==0):
  		sum = sum + i;
  	elif (i % 5 == 0):
  		sum = sum + i;
  	i+=1;
  print(sum);

{% endhighlight %}

 answer:
 {% highlight python %}
 233168
 {% endhighlight %}

 Problem 2:

Best Solution, Chip's solution. My solution follows...
{% highlight python %}
  sum = 0
  f1, f2 = 0, 1
  while f2 < 4000000:
     if f2 % 2 == 0:
         sum += f2
     f1, f2 = f2, f1 + f2
  print(sum)
{% endhighlight %}

  answer:
  {% highlight python %}
  4613732
  {% endhighlight %}
 {% highlight python %}

   ##########################################################################################
   # Even Fibonacci numbers
   #
   # Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
   # By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
   # 				1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89, ...
   # By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,
   # find the sum of the even-valued terms.
   ##########################################################################################
  fib = [0,1,1]; i = 2; sum = 1
  while(fib[i]<4000000):
     fib.append(fib[i]+fib[i-1])
     if (fib[i]%2):
         sum = sum + fib[i]
     i += 1

  print(sum)

 {% endhighlight %}

  answer:
  {% highlight python %}
  4613732
  {% endhighlight %}


 Problem 3:
----------------------------------------------------

<h1>day one</h1>

Today we will learn about variable assignment, user input, and printing to the console.

There are many data types in python. Some of the datatypes include...
1. int (signed integer type)
2. strings (string type)
3. boolean (True/ False)
4. float (floating point type)
5. time (date/ time type)
6. enum (enumerated type)

We will focus on the first 2 types today. A string is a sequence of characters, which can include numbers, letters, or characters, such as '. and ,'. Below the name 'Sonia' is being assigned to the variable x.

{% highlight python %}

  x = "Sonia"
  x = 'Sonia'

{% endhighlight %}

Both print out the same results. For string assignment, you can use either type of quotations; the single quotes, or the double quotes. The The one time you may decide to use one over the other is if you actually want to print out the quotes as in the example below.

{% highlight python linenos %}
  print("'Sonia'")
{% endhighlight %}
<b>output:</b>
{% highlight python linenos %}
  'Sonia'
{% endhighlight %}

An integer is a Real number, a non-decimal number. For example, -3, 5, and 1432 are all integers. When you do integer division, numbers are automatically floored. This means that the decimal part of the number becomes "irrelevant" and is taken out of the equation. An example follows...

{% highlight python linenos %}
  int(x = 7); int(y=3)
  x/y = 2
  y/x = 0
{% endhighlight %}

The only way to access the remainder of these numbers is to use the '%' operator.

{% highlight python linenos %}
  x%y = 1
  y%x = 7
{% endhighlight %}

A boolean is a data type that returns true or false, 1 or 0 respectively, depending on the statement that is even. For example

{% highlight python linenos %}
   x = 10 # assigning integer value 10 to x, does not produce output
   y = 5 # assigning integer value 5 to y, does not produce output
   x == y
   x != y
   x > y
   x < y
{% endhighlight %}

The above code returns the following...

{% highlight python linenos %}
   False
   True
   True
   False
{% endhighlight %}

We will create a simple game called, "Guess that number", that takes in a integer value from the user and lets them know if they guessed the number correctly.

First, I will show you how to capture user input. In python 3, you can use the command 'input', and assign the user's response to a variable as shown below...

{% highlight python linenos %}
  response = input('Guess a number between 1 and 10: ')
{% endhighlight %}

The following will be outputted to the console...
{% highlight python linenos %}
  Guess a number between 1 and 10:
{% endhighlight %}

Let's open a jupyter notebook.
The video below walks you through opening the notebook and

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1KPSJ3WWog?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

{% highlight python linenos %}
  guess = int(7)
  response = int(input('Guess a number: '))
  if (response == guess):
      print("Great guess! The number was 7")
  else:
      print("Wrong guess, the number was 7")
{% endhighlight %}

## Programming Challenge

Ask the user for their name, store it in a variable and print out...
Hello [the user's name]
Then, ask them for their age, and favorite color, and display the answers to the screen.
</br>

Hello, [insert name]! Nice to meet you. Your age is [age], and your favorite color is [insert color].
Is this information correct?

{extra} If the information is correct, tell the user 'Bye', otherwise, ask for the user's information again.

<h1>day zero</h1>

## Environment Setup

Make sure you have Python installed. We will be using Python3 throughout this 100 days. If you have a mac or a linux machine, you can check by opening up a terminal and typing the following commands.

{% highlight markdown %}
  python --version
{% endhighlight %}

Opening terminal,

Mac: To find terminal, go to your Launchpad, and click the "Other" app. You will see Terminal inside. Click on it.

Windows: Click on the start menu, and type in 'cmd'. Then press enter.

If you have a mac, it probably comes with Python 2.7.10 preinstalled.<br/>
Output:
{% highlight markdown %}
  Python 2.7.10
{% endhighlight %}

If you have a Windows machine, you can use the command as above to check your python version. If you do not know how to do this, it is ok, we will all be installing Anaconda, which will download all packages necessary for you to use Python. There is a video, by
Corey Schafer from youtube, at the bottom of this post that can guide you through the installation of Anaconda installation on both Mac and Windows.

## Downloading Anaconda
Go to the following link and click on download in the upper left hand corner. <br/>
[Anaconda Link](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/)

<center> <img src="../assets/anaconda_0.png">
</center>

Next click on your OS, Mac, Wndows, or Linux, which is circled in the blue in the image below. Once you have done that, click the download button in the Python 3.6 version box.

<center> <img src="../assets/anaconda_1.png">
</center>

Next, follow the installation steps given by the prompt.
<br/>Once you have installed anaconda, open up a terminal, for mac users, and cmd, for Windows users.

Mac: To find terminal, go to your Launchpad, and click the "Other" app. You will see Terminal inside. Click on it.

Windows: Click on the start menu, and type in 'cmd'. Then press enter.

Once you have terminal and cmd open, type the following...

{% highlight markdown %}
  jupyter notebook
{% endhighlight %}

Your jupyter notebook should start. This means you are ready to get started!! Stay tuned for day one, when we write our first program.

## VIDEO Tutorial:
You only need to pay attention to the first 3:11 minutes of the video.
