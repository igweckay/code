## Environment Setup

Make sure you have Python installed. We will be using Python3 throughout this 100 days. If you have a mac or a linux machine, you can check by opening up a terminal and typing the following commands.

{% highlight markdown %}
  python --version
{% endhighlight %}

If you have a mac, it probably comes with Python 2.7.10 preinstalled.<br/>
Output:
{% highlight markdown %}
  Python 2.7.10
{% endhighlight %}

If you have a Windows machine, you can use the command as above to check your python version. If you do not know how to do this, it is ok, we will all be installing Anaconda, which will download all packages necessary for you to use Python. There is a video, by
Corey Schafer from youtube, at the bottom of this post that can guide you through the installation of Anaconda installation on both Mac and Windows.

## Downloading Anaconda
Go to the following link and click on download in the upper left hand corner. <br/>
[Anaconda Link](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/)

Next click on your OS, Mac, Wndows, or Linux, which is circled in the blue in the image below. Once you have done that, click the download button in the Python 3.6 version box.

Next, follow the installation steps given by the prompt.
<br/>Once you have installed anaconda, open up a terminal, for mac users, and cmd, for Windows users.

Mac: To find terminal, go to your Launchpad, and click the "Other" app. You will see Terminal inside. Click on it.

Windows: Click on the start menu, and type in 'cmd'. Then press enter.

Once you have terminal and cmd open, type the following...

{% highlight markdown %}
  jupyter notebook
{% endhighlight %}

Your jupyter notebook should start. This means you are ready to get started!! Stay tuned for day one, when we write our first program.

## VIDEO Tutorial:
You only need to pay attention to the first 3:11 minutes of the video.
